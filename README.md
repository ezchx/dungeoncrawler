Free Code Camp Dungeon Crawler exercise.

Player starts with 100 health points and no weapon. Player can pick up a weapon and health packets. Enemy starts with 100 health points and a weapon. During a fight, whoever initiates the collision injures the opponent. For example, if you are adjacent to the enemy and he moves towards you first, your health is reduced and vice versa. Once you kill the enemy, you go to the next level.

Damage to the enemy increases with a weapon. Damage to both enemy and player increases by level. The enemy's speed doubles with every level. You can win the game by defeating the Big Boss on level 3.

You can make it even more challenging by clicking the window button to reduce the view window.
